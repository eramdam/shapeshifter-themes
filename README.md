Glitch Twitter bot template 
===================================

![Tweetin'](https://cdn.gomix.com/4032b241-bff8-473e-aa6b-eb0c92a4bd06%2Ftweeting.gif)

This is a template for making fun Twitter bots with [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) and the [Twit](https://github.com/ttezel/twit) node.js library.

## A quick tutorial

1. Create a new Twitter account and a new Twitter app. ([See how.](https://botwiki.org/tutorials/how-to-create-a-twitter-app/))
2. Update the `.env` file with your Twitter API key/secrets and change the `BOT_ENDPOINT` (it could just be random letters).
3. Update `server.js` with some cool Twitter bot code. (Make sure your bot follows [Twitter's rules](https://support.twitter.com/articles/18311-the-twitter-rules) and is overall [not a jerk](https://botwiki.org/articles/essays/).)
4. Set up a free service ([Uptime Robot](https://uptimerobot.com/), or [a similar one](https://www.google.com/search?q=free+web+cron)) to wake up your bot [every 25+ minutes](https://support.glitch.com/t/a-simple-twitter-bot-template/747/16) and tweet. Use `https://YOUR_PROJECT_NAME.glitch.me/BOT_ENDPOINT` as a URL to which to send the HTTP request.

The included example tweets out "hello world ðŸ‘‹". Check out [the Twit module documentation](https://github.com/ttezel/twit) for more examples of what your bot can do.

You can find more tutorials and open source Twitter bots on [Botwiki](https://botwiki.org). Be sure to [join Botmakers](https://botmakers.org/) and [submit your bot to Botwiki](https://botwiki.org/submit-your-bot) :-)

## Note on bots that auto-reply to DMs/@ mentions

Apps hosted on Glitch are automatically put to sleep after 5 minutes of inactivity (that is, if nobody opens your app in a browser window or it doesn't receive any data).

Twitter's API doesn't send requests to your app, instead your app has to poll Twitter for data. 

See [this Glitch starter project](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/twitterbot-autorespond) where i work around this limitation and make a Twitter bot that responds to DMs and @ mentions (with a [25 minute delay](https://support.glitch.com/t/a-simple-twitter-bot-template/747/16)).
